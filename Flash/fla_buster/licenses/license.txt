All parts of the software, excluding JsZip and JsZipUtils fall 
under this license which I may revoke at any time... (when A more properly
worded license is applied) 

This software is to remain Open Source
Attribution is to be provided where due

the included shapeTests.zip is public domain, do whatever you want to it...
It's a file I (@Brian151(github)) specifically requested from a friend 
to test how Flash saves shapes in certain circumstances. 
It's also updated at my request.
