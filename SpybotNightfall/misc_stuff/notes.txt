map width: 16tx X 13tx (might be wrong)
tile dimens= 32x32
tx0= NOTHING, it is the blank tile (a blank 30x30 image could be used as a placeholder if needed)
tx's (tiles) = 28 x 28 , offset should be 2px,2px
programs = 30 x 30, offest should be 1px,1px

item 2 (credits) = 14 x 14, offset should be 9px,9px
item 3 (logs) = 21 x 25, offset should be 3px,2px

map items:
"PROGRAM DOCK" = <texture in spriter's resource rips>
"BASIC CREDIT" = item 2
"WIN FLAG" = <unknown> (assumed item 3)

evil programs (textures in spriter's resource rips):
"Frag-Man" = bit-man

sound stuff:
as of Oct 30, 2016, I have actually determined a few things about how the sound data files work:
random [loopCount]:
when this line appears, it means to select a random track from the following list
if loopCount is set, this is how many times the track will play. default is one.
Music tracks are the only sounds that appear to use it
playlist
When this line appears, the following tracks play in order.
Far as I know, this is only used on snd_rollover_battle
Only one track plays each time the sound is told to play
I am still unsure about howthe sound engine overall worked
there's still an unknown bit of data, too
obviously, a track name is required, but...
they can be followed by three numbers, and Try as I might, IDK
what they are for.
The middle, in all examples is 255
I'm guessing the left and right have to do with bass and treble, or
some other pitch/tone-related adjustments, seeing as when snd_rollover_battle
plays, the sound gets higher in pitch

audio track file format:
technically, these are all MP3's.
However, they're a vairant used inside of shockwave called SWA
It basically contains some extra data.
From what I can tell, this extra data is beng played as sound,
that could be problematic...
