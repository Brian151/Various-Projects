RIFF: http://www.johnloomis.org/cpe102/asgn/asgn1/riff.html

(
basically, 
4 bytes chunkID
4 bytes chunklength
<chunklength> bytes chunkdata (plus extra byte if not even length)
)

special chunks (like "RIFF") have one extra field
(
4 bytes chunkID
4 bytes chunklength
4 bytes formtype ("WAVE", for example)
<chunklength> bytes chunkdata (plus extra byte if not even length)
	(
	sub-chunks
	)
)

RIFX:
network byte order / big-endian

XFIR:
network byte order / big-endian
EXCEPT
(
chunkID
chunklength
formtype (???)
), which are little-endian

SHOCKWAVE FORMAT:
two FIRX/RIFX chunks, second is probably invalid

FIRX [01]
(
chunklength x
formtype "MV93"
data (entire file, minus chunkID & chunklength), chunklength bytes long
)

sub-chunks:
free
(
	length always 0
	//but entire entry is always 0x14 in size
	these are basically just free space, and seem to serve no real purpose
)

shockwave format types:
DXR : protected/encrypted
DCR : compressed (via zlib???)
DIR : doesn't seem to be encrypted or compressed
CXT : protected/encrypted
CCT : compressed
CST : nothing special... 

purposes:
D*R : movie, runs stand-alone, may load C*T's as dependencies
C*T : 
(
external"cast" , basically an external library of stuff. 
D*R's are made of multiple internal casts, and will attempt to
load external casts if any have been linked.
Some movies can play without the external casts
External casts are essentially the same structure as a movie,
except they only contain one cast, and cannot run as a stand-alone application.
)

extra notes:
Spybotics, does not actually require its external casts to run.
However, this might impact the music*

*All remaining copies/archives of Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident
do not have the sound_level_<1-5>.cct, and the snd_netload_<1-5>.cct files.
It's quite possible official releases never actually did use them.
the sound_level_<x> files are all empty, and the snd_netload_<x> files
contain alternative soundtracks. These tracks probably are for databattles.
