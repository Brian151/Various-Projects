			this hacked together HTML with a very unorthadox flash embed serves one purpose:
			it embeds the loading animation (which is actually a flash movie) at the intended 
			screen resolution. That way, some elements can be hard-ripped, or the text can be observed
			a little easier, since under normal conditions, the game will load rather quickly.
			Really, there's no escaping using a flash decompiler on this... But, I'm in a tough position, there,
			most of my programs and files were "cleaned" by my father...
