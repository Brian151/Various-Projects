all scripts cannot be recovered at this time
To do so requires the original .dir surfacing,
or a functional shockwave decompiler to exist.

However, I figured it would still be useful to have the script names & types,
as a reference point for what kind of tasks any port/clone would need to
accomplish, besides the ones that are evident from gameplay, alone.

script listing files are named as
"_scripts." + <castName>

entry format: [name, type]
