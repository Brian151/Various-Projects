"DISARRAY: CLEARLY THEIR LOSS. so i guess by now you know the whole nightfall story, huh?", 
"Why are you trying to crash the net?"

#D1: [
"DISARRAY: simple.  the nightfall software i set up is going to take every single node off-line.  that means i will control who gets access to the net and who doesn't.",
"so?"

#d2: [
"DISARRAY: people will be begging me to get back on-line.  And i'll let them, just as long as they're willing to pay for the privilege.  i'll make Billions.  what can i say - it's a brilliant plan.", 
"that will never happen."

"DISARRAY: Actually, it will.  you don't have the codes to access my private node, and even if you did, you'd never beat my security.  you're just a pathetic newbie.  so why don't you stop wasting your time fighting me and GO save up your credits to pay me off later?", 
"You're going down, disarray."

"DISARRAY: suit yourself.  it'll be fun to show you just how inferior you are.   l8r, loser.",
"we'll see."
