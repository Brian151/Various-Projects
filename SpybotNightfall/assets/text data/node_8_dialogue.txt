"SUPERPHREAK:  Yeah, I'm back.  I see you got the access codes.  i'll think i'll have time to upgrade your status and show you a new warez node  before i GET CUT OFF again.",

"SuperPhreak:  Someone's been screwing around with S.M.A.R.T.  Some kind of corrupt program got loose in our network and I got cut off.   For a second, I thought it was 12am out here.",

"12am?"

#C1: [
"SuperPhreak:  12am = midnight. that's WHAT WE CALL A TOTAL NETWORK BLackout — no access for anybody.  It happened once a while ago during the worldwide power crisis. You wouldn't believe how bad it got before the network came back online.",

"SuperPhreak:  Anyway, someone directly sabotaged  S.M.A.R.T. and it's crippling our agents.  BUT IT'S NOT AFFECTING YOU BECAUSE we haven't put your INFO inTO the S.M.A.R.T. system yet.",

#E1: [
"SuperPhreak:  I'm not sure yet, I'm going to keep looking into it.  But with all of us popping in and out, I guess that leaves you as the only functional agent.  ", 
"GREAT.",
"I'M READY."
