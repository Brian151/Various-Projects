company_logo_<1-5> have all the same graphics, aside from
very slight differences in the shape/frame that is actually
displayed. They do not warrant creating an .fla, and there's
a ton of redundancy in doing so. All that is needed from them
are the images, nothing more.

opening_anim is far more advanced, it does have a few scripts,
and it bears nested animations. There is some sense in exporting it as
a .fla
