	These were various tests to see what kind of hurdles are present if HTML5 audio
	were to be used. Result is a definitive "there are SEVERAL challenges to overcome
	if using the HTML5 audio systems..." (that i might add aren't present in plugins... >.<)

	This specific section was an attempt to change the pitch of s.cancel
	programmatically. Supposedly, the only way shockwave had to do this
	was with a rateShift property (that's very poorly documented). I am not sure
	if Gamelab used this, or if they actually wrote a proper audio system to alter 
	how a particular track sounded. Attempts to alter the .swa's in aduacity have
	been quite fruitless (in fact, they don't even play right). If it's possible,
	I could sacrifice a bit of filesize to just create the pitch-changed versions as files,
	but I'd really rather not do that. (Mainly because if I want to create even MORE variations 
	later down the road, that starts wasting space, and really just becomes chaotic to manage
	in the code)
