visual/illuminati_confirmed.bmp | original name : "cool_credit.bmp"

_cct: contains the cast members extracted from any of the 10 external casts.
(.cct files) However, only 5 of them actually contain anything. The external
casts all are intended to add additional sound, but I am unsure if they
were actually released to the public. I got mine stright from the original
developers.

_scripts: contains the name and type of any script within the game.
Scripts cannot actually be recovered, sadly...

_SWF: these were extracted with a third party tool, they are the flash cast
members from the entire movie. 6 of them were moved an re-named to visual,
where they rightly belong. The two remaining are of unknown origin, and
I suspect were a mis-interepretation of other data

_temp: various WIP stuff, typically attempts to hard-rip certain assets

_TSR: The only known public rips from this game until I released my stuff,
came from the Spriters Resource. The methods by which they were ripped
are unknown.

animations: contains four film loops (can't export), and the frames for them.
I exported the frames and will re-assemble the animations later. Used for the 
animations when your spybot is connecting to a node.

misc: tons and tons of configuration data

sound: most of the sounds and music for the game, and various settings for how to
play them are found here. There's also a script which most likely is the entire 
sound engine, bummer...

text data: more configuration data, and also contains nearly all of the dialogue.

tiles: Contains almost everything found in a databattle. (tiles, program graphics,
item graphics)

tutorial: Contains the text, and basically all of the graphics used in the
tutorial level. Seems to be haphazardly organized, and I wonder if it might
be one of the oldest sections of the game.

visual: lots and lots of film loops, buttons, and some flash assets, and PLENTY
of bitmaps. Most of what's here seems to be intended for the GUI or game background
almost exclusively.

worldMap: this contains the netmap background, node graphics, and the line
overlays.

_checklist: marks which casts have been entirely processed (or as far as
I will consider "entirely")

_readme: this file

levelData: The data for EVERY map in the released game, I combined it all
together into one file.
