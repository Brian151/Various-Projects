directories/files starting with underscore either came from sources besides the 
main executable, had to be extracted by alternative methods,
are just listings of something,
or are just temp directories where I'm fixing assets up

everything else is named according to the internal names within the main executable,
for the most part

visual/illuminati_confirmed.bmp | original name : "cool_credit.bmp"
