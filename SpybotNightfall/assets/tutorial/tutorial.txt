SUPERPHREAK: Welcome to your first DataBattle. Here your programs duke it out with the enemy programs for control of a node.
}

TutText_2
{
SUPERPHREAK: First you have to upload your programs.  Start by clicking on this upload spot.
}

TutText_3
{
SUPERPHREAK: Now click on this program to upload it.
}

TutText_4
{
SUPERPHREAK: Now click on the next upload spot.
}

TutText_5
{
SUPERPHREAK: Upload this program.
}

TutText_6
{
SUPERPHREAK: Alright.  Let's get this battle started.
}

TutText_7
{
SUPERPHREAK: All of your programs move and execute commands first, and then all of the enemy programs get their chance.
}

TutText_8
{
SUPERPHREAK: Click on this program to select it.
}

TutText_9
{
SUPERPHREAK: The highlighted grid squares show how far this program can move.  Before we move it, let's see what it can do. 
Hack is a simple battle program with only one command.  Click on the command to see what it does. 
}

TutText_11
{
SUPERPHREAK: The red squares show you the range for this command. This program has to move next to an enemy program to attack. So let's move it first. 
Click on undo to cancel the command.
}

TutText_12
{
SUPERPHREAK: Now click on this square to move the program.
}

TutText_13
{
SUPERPHREAK: When a program moves through memory, it expands. Each square of a program is called a sector.
The Max Size shows how much a program will expand as it moves. When a program reaches its max size, it can still move but the older sectors will disappear.
}

TutText_14
{
SUPERPHREAK: We're still out of range. Click this square to move the program again.
}

TutText_15
{
SUPERPHREAK: Okay, now that we're next to the program, let's use that attack command.  
Click on the command button.
}

TutText_16
{
SUPERPHREAK: To execute an attack command, click on any sector of an enemy program that is within range.
Click here to execute this command.
}

TutText_17
{
SUPERPHREAK: Nice. Now let's move our other program.  Click here to select it. 
}

TutText_18
{
Move the program closer to your target.
}

TutText_19
{
SUPERPHREAK: Slingshot is a ranged attack program.  
I think we're in range now.  Click on the command to activate it.
}

TutText_20
{
SUPERPHREAK: Good. Now click on the enemy program to execute the command.
}

TutText_21
{
SUPERPHREAK: Way to go. You just won your first databattle.
}

TutText_22
{
SUPERPHREAK: Of course, most databattles won't be as easy as this one.  You'll need to pick up more powerful programs from warez nodes on the network.
Some advanced programs have more than one command. Special commands can be used to increase the power of your own programs or even change the Grid.
}

TutText_22(2)
{
SUPERPHREAK: Ok, those are the basics.  Do you want me to go over it again?
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE NETMAP, YOU'LL BE ON YOUR OWN. CLICK ON A NODE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT THERE. GOOD LUCK!
