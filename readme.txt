various projects, all fall under different licenses, 
and all are deemed too incomplete/small to warrant a 
specific repo at this time.

Nothing here is offically supported, and released projects 
generally take priority over all of these should an issue be filed.

THERE IS NO REASON REALLY TO FORK THIS WHOLE THING
(I'm not gonna stop you...but, it's more of a dumping grounds, not a project)
Please do not create pull requests, 
I'll either just ignore them, or manually merge useful changes
into their respective project directories.
You are welcome to file an issue if you have something that I might find useful to add/change

Projects given their own repo will be removed from here
