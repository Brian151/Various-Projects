/*NOTICE:
Do NOT ask me to:
[1]create the glassy animation/transparency
[2]test aforementioned feature
[3]research how to create said feature
[4]ANYTHING to do with making it super-HD...
[5]YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN, CUZ:
[A]It probably has awful performance
[B]This is not a Windows OS Sim
[C]It's pretty un-necesarry
[D]It may well require throwing the canvas element in there, and other stuff I DON'T wanna mess with
