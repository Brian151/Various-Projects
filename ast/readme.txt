description: Asteroids 2600 clone
title: ???

Due to a combination of IRL events, this did not see completion
It's not scrapped by a longshot, though... just delayed

why this version?
It's actually the first version I ever played, or that I recall playing.
Technically, the one I played was also a port, as it was on a 
plug 'n play system.

tech features:
1. generating ImageDatas from a JSON template and scaling them by whole numbers
2. On-demand runtime asset creation.

HOW is this pre-dertermined?
1. By all technical definitions, anything and everything follows a specific pattern.
1b. Is this pattern observable? probably not. Only by reading the code...XD
Originally, I had much bolder and very unquestionably pre-determined 
mechanics in mind, but I procrastinated far too long to implement them on time.

WHY, specifically did this not get completed?
1. I got a bit lazy
2. My family is great at causing me depression
3. After said depression, an IRL event related to 
cause of depression made me unable to continue the project

What will I add/change in the future?
1. First, I'll get it up to par with what my final plans were for it.
2. Then I may add some extra stuff I was considering adding
3. I might then turn ths back into the original concept
3b. rough idea, title might be "hackeroids" , the player would 
have an insanely intimate relationship with the game's inner workings.
At the most extreme, you could spend an entire day (or more) making 
"asteroid art" (like pixel art, but with asteroids)
4. I probably will submit this to Kongregate if I am allowed.
As it stands, there are clones of retro games there, already, but I'm not
100% what Kong's TOS would state about that, there are copyright 
things to consider...unfortunately

==LICENSE==
Free for non-commercial use only, 
please credit atari for their artwork assets and the original game.
Do not claim anything here as your own, unless you specifically created it
exclusivity (temporary):
Since someone submitting this to Kong or whereever before me 
could cause me problems trying to upload it myself, 
DON'T subit to Kongregate, DeviantArt, or Newgrounds. 
After I have submitted it to one or more of these places, 
or decided not to, this section will be dropped.
Finally, (Oh, please don't hate me...), 
whichever version of this license you have 
is overridden by the most recent version on my github.
Generally speaking, this is to carry-over the effects of removing conditions,
not adding them. This license will also be automatically terminated 
when/if one of the official and more properly crafted licenses is put 
into effect.
You MAY replace this license with the latest version from my repo, 
but you may not modify it in any way. Do note when/if CC, MIT, GNU
this will no longer be the case, and you must strictly follow whatever terms
the provided license states (one of which tends to be they're non-revokable, and thus,
cannot be replaced) (yeah, hopefully that's not confusing...)
exemptions:
the original atari assets can't be re-licensed, but there are some things I
strongly encourage you to do, anyways.
You generally should use them in an ethical, moral, and legal way.
Please credit Atari (and/or the particular artist(s) that made them), and
do NOT sell them. Obviously, you didn't create them, and derivative works
should mention that theyre derivatives, or inspired off of.
Again, I can't mandate anyone to do that, but do realize that if people were
to mis-use the sprites I have ripped, Atari could (and likely would) take legal action.
That'd be a real bummer ):
