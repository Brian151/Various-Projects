These are all various conceptual things I'm working on for the library, 
or that could be an advantage to add to it.
They are in various states of development, most all are buggy (even if seeming ok).
Some are being developed together with the library, and others are entirely separate
from it. All are to be considered experimental. Use at own risk, they are not officially
supported until full implementation.
