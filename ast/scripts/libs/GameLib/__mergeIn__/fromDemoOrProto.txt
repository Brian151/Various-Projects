GAME LIB FEATURE:
codename 'Aero'
(goal is to re-create the Aero glass* effect with the UI component system)
*Windows Vista and Windows 7 had a beautiful theme called Aero, 
one feature was a gradient pattern that appears on the titlebars, which made them look
kinda of like glass.
there's also some color filters in-progress.
