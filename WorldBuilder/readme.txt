Goal: render a worldbuilder style map
stretch: port entire game
status: untested...

This is a fan project of the old LEGO Shockwave game, WorldBuilder,
originally made by GameLab NY. (since been shut-down)

It is lower priority than a project concerning another one of their games,
Spybotics : The Nightfall Incident
(
Said project from the get-go also was to completey port the whole game.
This will take a while, and I just simply can't get code due to the shockwave format being closed,
and the devs either don't have the code (i believe them, though) , or just cannot share it
Since I have no coderefs for how to do these projects, they will be some of my hardest ones,
relying heavily on every screenshot, guide, data file, and gameplay video I can get
Taking on two such projects at once is basically suicide, and I also liked Spybotics more
because I actually came close to beating it, unlike WorldBuilder.
)
So, why even put any effort into WorldBuilder?
A: I still DO like it, and it's threatened to just die if someone doesn't at least try to update it
B: It's an example of non-square tiles and/or tiles that aren't offset by 0, 
so practice with creating+rendering tiles that don't folow a strictly square
or rectangular grid. (hexagonal tiles and isometric projection 
do this, and I want to play with those some time in the future)
C: and where B applies, the same tends to be true for the objects/characters. 
How they move, how they're z-sorted, etc...
